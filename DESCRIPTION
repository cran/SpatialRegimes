Description: A collection of functions for estimating spatial regimes, aggregations of neighboring spatial units that are homogeneous in functional terms. The term spatial regime, therefore, should not be understood as a synonym for cluster. More precisely, the term cluster does not presuppose any functional relationship between the variables considered, while the term regime is linked to a regressive relationship underlying the spatial process.
